.SH NAME
\fBcups-browsed \fP- A daemon for browsing the Bonjour broadcasts of shared, remote CUPS printers

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBcups-browsed\fP has three independently switchable functions:
.IP 1. 4
Browse Bonjour broadcasts of remote printers and create/remove local
raw queues pointing to these printers.
.IP 2. 4
Browse CUPS broadcasts of remote printers and create/remove local raw
queues pointing to these printers.
.IP 3. 4
Broadcast local queues with the CUPS protocol.
.PP
Note that 2. and 3. are only to allow communication with legacy CUPS servers (1.5.x or older) on the remote machine(s). The standard method to broadcast for shared/network printers to broadcast their presence is Bonjour. The CUPS broadcasting/browsing protocol is deprecated.

cups-browsed can be run permanently (from system boot to shutdown) or on-demand (for example to save resources on mobile devices). For running it on-demend an auto-shutdown feature can be activated to let cups-browsed terminate when it does not have queues any more to take care of.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B
\fB-v\fP, \fB-d\fP, \fB--debug\fP
Debug mode
.TP
.B
\fB--autoshutdown=mode\fP
Auto shutdown mode, \fBmode\fP is \fBoff\fP for no auto shutdown, \fBon\fP for auto shutdown being active, and \fBavahi\fP for control by the avahi-daemon being run on-demand, getting auto-shutdown turned off while avahi-daemon is present and on when avahi-daemon is shut down.
.TP
.B
\fB--autoshutdown-timeout=timeout\fP
\fBtimeout\fP tells after how many seconds cups-browsed should shut down if it has no local queues set up for any discovered remote printer any more. Default is 30 seconds. 0 means immediate shutdown.
.SH FILES
/etc/cups/cups-browsed.conf
.SH SIGNALS
\fISIGINT, SIGTERM\f1: cups-browsed will shutdown.

\fISIGUSR1\f1: Switches cups-browsed into permanent mode (no auto shutdown).

\fISIGUSR2\f1: Switches cups-browsed into auto shutdown mode.

.SH NOTES
Please take references to cups 1.6.x to include newer versions.
Similarily, cups 1.5.x is intended to encompass older versions too.
.PP
In environments with only cups 1.6.x servers and clients (plus
\fBcups-browsed\fP on either server or client or both) the function described in 1.
enables the automatic discovery of remote queues and their display in
printing dialogues of applications and with command line tools.
.PP
The facility provided by 3. means that servers running cups 1.6.x plus
\fBcups-browsed\fP can broadcast their local queues so that clients with cups
1.5.x get these queues automatically available. The outcome of 2. is
that clients running cups 1.6.x plus \fBcups-browsed\fP can use the CUPS
broadcasts from servers with cups 1.5.x. As with browsing of Bonjour
broadcasts, the created local raw queues are available to applications
and command line tools.
