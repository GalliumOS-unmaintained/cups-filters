 otherwise, or **(ii)** ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of

 “You” (or “Your”) shall mean an individual or Legal Entity exercising

 including but not limited to software source code, documentation
 source, and configuration files.

 “Object” form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical

 limited to compiled object code, generated documentation, and
 conversions to other media types.
 .
 “Work” shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object
 form, made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright
 notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example is
 provided in the Appendix below).
 .
 “Derivative Works” shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
 form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
 editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other
 modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of
 authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall
 not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind
 by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
 .
 “Contribution” shall mean any work of authorship, including the
 original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to
 that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
 submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright
 owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on
 behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition,
 “submitted” means any form of electronic, verbal, or written
 communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including
 but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source
 code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by,

 “Not a Contribution.”
 .
 “Contributor” shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
 on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
 subsequently incorporated within the Work.

 #### 2. Grant of Copyright License
 .
 Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor
 hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
 no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce,
 prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
 sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in
 Source or Object form.
 .
 #### 3. Grant of Patent License
 .
 Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor
 hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
 no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this
 section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell,
 import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies
 only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are
 necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by
 combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such
 Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation
 against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
 lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within
 the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then
 any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work
 shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
 .
 #### 4. Redistribution
 .
 You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative
 Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in
 Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following
 conditions:
 .
 * **(a)** You must give any other recipients of the Work or
   Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
 .
 * **(b)** You must cause any modified files to carry prominent
   notices stating that You changed the files; and
 .
 * **(c)** You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
   that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
   attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding
   those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative
   Works; and
 .
 * **(d)** If the Work includes a “NOTICE” text file as part of its
   distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
   include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within
   such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to
   any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following
   places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the
   Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if
   provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display
   generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party
   notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for
   informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may
   add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You
   distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the
   Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be
   construed as modifying the License.
 .
 You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
 may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for
 use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any
 such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction,
 and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions
 stated in this License.
 .
 #### 5. Submission of Contributions
 .
 Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally
 submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be
 under the terms and conditions of this License, without any
 additional terms or conditions.  Notwithstanding the above, nothing
 herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license
 agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such
 Contributions.
 .
 #### 6. Trademarks

 This License does not grant permission to use the trade names,
 trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except
 as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin
 of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
 .
 #### 7. Disclaimer of Warranty
 .
 Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor
 provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions)
 on an “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND,
 either express or implied, including, without limitation, any
 warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY,
 or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for
 determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work
 and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions
 under this License.
 .
 #### 8. Limitation of Liability
 .
 In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including
 negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable
 law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in
 writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages,
 including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential
 damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out
 of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to
 damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or
 malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even
 if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such
 damages.
 .
 #### 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability
 .
 While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may
 choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support,
 warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights
 consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations,
 You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility,
 not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to
 indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any
 liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor
 by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional
 liability.
